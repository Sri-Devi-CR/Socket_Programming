# Socket_Programming

This repository contains Python code for client-server socket programming, implemented using both TCP and UDP protocols. The project was developed as a requirement for the INCS course during my 3rd semester.


# Requirements
• Python 3.x
• No external libraries required (standard library modules only)


# Learning Objectives
• Understanding the fundamentals of socket programming in Python.
• Implementing both connection-oriented and connectionless communication methods.
• Gaining hands-on experience with TCP and UDP protocols.
